## Spring Boot 
#### Ex. 1 - First Spring Boot project with Maven: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/
#### Ex. 2 - First Spring Boot REST endpoint: create a REST endpoint exposing HTTP GET and print "Hello World" to the client
#### Ex. 3 - Expose a set of REST endpoints by following the CRUD paradigma: the underline database is a MySQL one. Let's suppose we're modelling Personas where a Persona is featured by (Nome, Cognome, DataDiNascita, Eta)
#### Ex. 4 - Take third exercise and change the database: now we're going to use MongoDB!
#### Ex. 5 - Let's create a Docker Compose of third and fourth exercises (use Docker on Linux machine, Windows will make you crazy)

##### Notes:
    - 1) You will work on a Git branch, the branch is named with your name. Create your own directory on this repository, the folder should be named with your name. Into this folder you should create a folder for each exercise (number of ex will be enough). It would be great if you create a markdown with your comments, suggestions or notes. At the end of your training, you should submit a merge request on master branch.
    - 1) Pay attention to DataDiNascia field format
    - 2) Use a local MySql database or the one in Reply Network:
        Host: 10.46.90.132
        Port: 3306
        Username: mysqlPoste
        Password: ''
    - 3) Each exercise must be completed by its own JUnits test suite
